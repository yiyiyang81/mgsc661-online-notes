## Lab Solution Code
```python
import pandas as pd
import statsmodels.api as sm
from statsmodels.duration.hazard_regression import PHReg

# Load the dataset from a local CSV file
data = pd.read_csv('heart_transplant.csv')

# Preprocess the data
# Convert 'transplant' into a categorical variable where 'treatment' = 1, 'control' = 0
data['transplant'] = data['transplant'].apply(lambda x: 1 if x == 'treatment' else 0)

# Convert 'survived' into a binary variable where 'alive' = 0, 'dead' = 1
data['event'] = data['survived'].apply(lambda x: 1 if x == 'dead' else 0)

# Remove rows where 'survtime' or 'transplant' is NA if any
data = data.dropna(subset=['survtime', 'transplant'])

# Define the model using a formula, where 'survtime' is the follow-up time and 'event' is the event indicator
# Include relevant covariates such as age and whether they received a transplant
model = PHReg.from_formula('survtime ~ age + transplant', data, status=data['event'])

# Fit the model
result = model.fit()

# Result 1
print("="*10,"Result 1", "="*10)
# Print results summary
print(result.summary())
```

Confidence intervals are for the hazard ratios

Hazard Ratio(HR):
- for age, the hazard ratio is 1.0618, indicating that for each unit increase in age, the hazard of death increases by 6.18%.
- for transplant, the hazard ratio is 0.1684, which means that the effect of receiving a transplant improves survival rate by (1-0.1684)*100% = 83.16%. 

HR can vary over several orders of magnitude, and taking the log of HR helps to interpret the results more easily.

log HR is just the coefficient($\beta$) of the covariate in the model. The exponential of the log HR gives the hazard ratio.

Both age and transplant status are significant predictors of survival time.
