## Survival Analysis Basic Concepts
### Time-to-Event Data
crucial in the field like medicine and engineering where we observe the expected duration of the time until an event of interest occurs. Can be used for customer churn, employee retention, etc.

### Censoring
The censoring occurs when exact time of event is not observed by the experimenter(the exact time that the event happens is unknown).
When the event happens before it is observed, or when the participant leaves the experiment early. 

Some examples of censoring:
- Drug treatment tests - determine the exact effect of treatment of some drug, but sometimes the study needs to stop before we observe an outcome for all patients, or some patients may drop out the study early.
- Recall forecasting for warranty claims(failure analysis) - the time of failure is not known after the warrantly claims. 
- Distinction between demand and sales data - usually we consider the sales information about the demand, but sales is actually censored demand data, as there is the inventory limitation. 

### Survival Time vs. Censoring Time
For each observation, a true survival time $T$ which may be censored at a censoring time $C$. The observed time is the minimum of the two, denoted by 
 $$Y = min(T, C)$$
We can also use $\delta \in \{0, 1\}$ as the indicator variable, where $\delta = 1$ if the event is observed, and $\delta = 0$ if the event is censored.

Left censoring: the event of interest happens before the measuring time begins. 

Interval censoring: the event happens between two measuring times(Machine has failed between monthly check, don't know the exact time of failure).

Right censoring: the survival time is censored by the censoring time.

For this course, we will focus on right censoring.

### Survival Function
The survival function $S(t)$ is the probability that the event of interest surviving past time $t$.

$$S(t) = P(T > t)$$

#### Example:

In the context of subscription service, $S(t)$ is the probability that a customer will cancel the service after time $t$ (survived until time $t$). 
If $S(t) = 0.85$ at $t = 6$ when the unit of measurement is month, then 85% of the customers are still subscribed after 6 months. 

## Method
How to estimate the survival function from the data?
### [Kaplan-Meier Estimator](6.2.2.KaplanMeierEstimator.md)
The Kaplan-Meier model provides a way to estiamte the survival curve using censored data.
