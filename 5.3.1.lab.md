From the result we can generally see that the ECLAT algorithm tends to find very strong association rules with high confidence and lift values. For example, the association rule between "PACK OF 6 SKULL PAPER PLATES" and "PACK OF 6 SKULL PAPER CUPS" has a confidence of 1.0 and lift of 16.0, indicating that the purchase of "PACK OF 6 SKULL PAPER PLATES" increases the likelihood of purchasing "PACK OF 6 SKULL PAPER CUPS" by 16 times compared to the purchase of "PACK OF 6 SKULL PAPER CUPS" alone.

## Conclusion
The Apriori algorithm tends to find more diverse itemsets and association rules, capturing a broader spectrum of relationships.
The ECLAT algorithm, by focusing on the intersection of TID lists, tends to identify very strong and specific associations, which might explain the uniformity in support and lift values.
