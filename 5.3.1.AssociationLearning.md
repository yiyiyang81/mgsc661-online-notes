## Overview
Association learning: discovering patterns and **co-occurence** of items in a dataset

### Range of Applications
- Market Basket Analysis: Supermarket, Online Retail
- Recommendation Systems: Amazon, Netflix

Discover "frquently purchased together" items in a supermarket for certain types of business goals. 

## Apriori Algorithm
- "building up" or a "bottom up" approach
- start with simplest itemsets and increase the size of itemsets one at a time. 
- In the context of market basket analysis, the algorithm finds the most frequent itemsets in a transaction database and identifies association rules between items.

### Steps:
1. set support threshold (minimum number of transactions an itemset must appear in to be considered frequent before any comparison) and remove the items that do not meet the support threshold
2. for each possible pair of items, the algorithm counts the number of transactions where both items appear
3. prune pairs to only keep the pairs that meet the support threshold
3. now on top of the pairs, the algorithm creates triples of items and counts the number of transactions where all three items appear, and prunes the triples to only keep the triples that meet the support threshold
4. repeat the process until no more frequent itemsets can be found

> This algorithm is computationally very expansive when the dataset is large, number of combinations grows exponentially with the number of items in the dataset.

which introduces the other algorithm: 

## ECLAT
- Stans for "Equivalence Class Clustering and bottom up Lattice Traversal"
- works with a vertical transformation of the transaction data. 

### Steps:
1. Vertically transform the transaction data into list of items and the transactions in which they appear
2. For each item, count the number of transactions in which the item appears
3. Prune the items that do not meet the support threshold
3. Perform set operations by intersecting the pairs in which each item appears to find the transactions in which triplets of items appear
4. Choose the pairs that meet the support threshold
5. Repeat the process until no more frequent itemsets can be found

### Several differences between ECLAT and Apriori:
If you are using the Apriori algorithm, you will need to scan for each item how many times it has appeared with another item in the dataset. Then you need to count again how many times the pairs of items have appeared with another item in the dataset. This can be computationally expensive.

- Instead of counting all the combinations, ECLAT lists out all the items in the dataset and the transactions in which they appear.
- For example, if "Bread" appears in transactions T1, T3, and T5, the TID list for "Bread" would be {T1, T3, T5}.
- ECLAT uses a "depth-first search" strategy(iterate through all transactions for each product) to count the number of transactions in which the items appear together. (Apriori uses a "breadth-first search" strategy, increase the size of itemsets one at a time)


## Terms
### Support
How frequently the itemset appears in the dataset with respect to the total number of transactions.

### Confidence
How often the rule is found to be true. Quantifies the likelihood of finding item Y in a transaction that contains item X.
