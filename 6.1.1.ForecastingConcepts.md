## Forecasting Concepts
### What is Forecasting?
Forecasting means "To make predictions about the future events based on past data". It has a wild range of applications in finance, economics, supply chain, weather, etc.

### Why Forecasting?
Helps in decision making, planning and budgeting. e.g. Amazon Forcasting - Amazon organize stock levels, pricing, and delivery schedules based on forecasts.

However, forecasting is a very difficult task, as there can always be unexpected events that can affect the outcome.

## Quantitative vs Qualitative Forecasting
### Quantitative Forecasting
Rich historical data suggests quantitative forecasting.
- Export opinion
- Market research
- User sentiment analysis


### Qualitative Forecasting
when the historical data is sparse or non-existent, qualitative forecasting is preferred. When the market is volatile, qualitative forecasting is also preferred.
- Exectutive judgement: based on experience and intuition
- Market research: surveys, focus groups
- Consensus forecasting: collective opinion of a group of experts
- Delphi method: a group of experts reach a consensus through a series of questionnaires and a facility provides the final forecast

### Time Series analysis
> a type of quantitative forecasting 

#### Key components
- Trend: long-term movement in the data during a period of time
- Seasonality: regular patterns of fluctuations that occur at specific intervals like daily, weekly, monthly, etc.
- Cyclicality: patterns that occur at irregular intervals, e.g. business cycles
- Irregularity: random variations in the data

Understanding the components of time series data is crucial for building accurate forecasting models.

## Methods
### Simple Moving Average Method
Calcualtes an average of specified number of data points to forecast the next data point.

$$F_t = \frac{A_{t-1} + A_{t-2} + ... + A_{t-n}}{n}$$

where:
- $F_t$ is the forecasted value at time $t$
- $A_{t-1}, A_{t-2}, ... A_{t-n}$ are the  values at time $t-1, t-2, ... t-n$
- $n$ is the number of data points to consider

e.g. when we want a 3-week moving average, we take the average of the last 3 weeks to forecast the next week.

In order to be able to measure the model performance, to decide the window size, we need to define forecase accuracy metrics to evaluate the model.

$$\text{Forecase Error} =\text{Forecast Value} - \text{Actual Value}\\ = F_t - A_t
$$


### Mean Absolute Deviation
$$MAD = \frac{\sum_{t=1}^{n} |A_t - F_t|}{n}$$

where:
- $n$ is the number of actual and forecast pairs

### Weighted Moving Average
Assigns weights to the data points to forecast the next data point. This allows us to have more flexibility in the model and place a greater emphasis or greater weights on recent data points.

### Exponential Smoothing
Also a technique that places more weight on recent observations, but it does so by using a smoothing factor $\alpha$ that is between 0 and 1. The smoothing factor determines the rate at which the weights decrease as we move further back in time.

$$F_t = \alpha A_{t-1} + (1-\alpha)F_{t-1}\\
F_t = F_{t-1} + \alpha(A_{t-1} - F_{t-1})$$

where:
- $F_t$ is the forecasted value at time $t$
- $A_{t-1}$ is the actual value at time $t-1$
- $F_{t-1}$ is the forecasted value at time $t-1$
- $\alpha$ is the smoothing factor between 0 and 1

> The choice of $\alpha$ is crucial in exponential smoothing. A smaller value of $\alpha$ will place more weight on the past observations, while a larger value of $\alpha$ will place more weight on the recent observations. $F_{t-1}$ essentially gives prior historical value. 


We also want a way to derive a forecast distribution for the demand next season using the historical data.
### A/F Ratio
Actual to Forecast ratio is a measure of forecast accuracy. It is calculated by dividing the actual demand by the forecast demand.

$$\text{A/F Ratio} = \frac{A_t}{F_t}$$

where:
- $A_t$ is the actual demand at time $t$
- $F_t$ is the forecasted demand at time $t$

> If the A/F ratio is greater than 1, it means that the forecast was too low. If the A/F ratio is less than 1, it means that the forecast was too high.

We can then derive: 
$$ \text{Actual Demand} = \text{Forecast Demand} \times \text{A/F Ratio}$$
$$ \text{Expected Actual Demand} = \text{Forecast Demand} \times E(\text{A/F Ratio})$$
$$ \text{SD of Actual Demand} = \text{Forecast Demand} \times SD(\text{A/F Ratio})$$

This provides some information on the variability of the demand.


## Quantitative Forcasting Tips
- Visualization: helps in understanding data patterns, trends, and anomalies
- Forecasts are always "wrong"
    - Forecasts have a degree of uncertainty and error. The goal is not to achieve perfect accuracy but to minimize the error and improve overall time. 
    - Always consider the range of outcomes and the uncertainty around the forecast. Use measurements like confidence intervals and prediction intervals to express the uncertainty around the forecast.
- Aggregated forecasts are more accurate than disaggregated forecasts
    - Aggregated forecasts combine data from multiple sources or groups, which tend to be more accurate than disaggregated forecasts that focus on individual items or small segments.
