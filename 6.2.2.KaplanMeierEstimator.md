## Estimating the survival curve
The Kaplain-Meier cruve plots the survival rate $S(t)$ on the y-aixs and $t$ on the x-axis.

The curve shows the probability of surviving past time $t$ for each point in time.

For example, for dental filling survival, if we have the x value of 5 years, the y value of 0.7 means that there is an 70% chance that the dental filling will survive past 5 years. 

## Method
### Constructing the Kaplan-Meier Curve
As we have the survival time and censoring time, we can calculate the survival rate $S(t)$ for each time point $t$. 

The Kaplan-Meier estimates the surval rate S(t) as: 
$$\hat{S}(t) = S(t_{i\leq t}) \times \left(1 - \frac{d_i}{n_i}\right)$$

where:
- $S(t_{i-1})$ is the survival rate at the previous time point
- $d_i$ is the number of events at time $t_i$
- $n_i$ is the number of subjects at risk at time $t_i$

### Log-Rank Test
Another powerful use of the Kaplan-Meier estimator is that it allows us to compare the survival rates of different sub-groups of data to study the impact of different treatment groups on the survival rate.

The log-rank test is a statistical test that compares the survival rates of two or more groups. It tests the null hypothesis that there is no difference between the survival rates of the groups.

The log-rank test is a non-parametric test, meaning that it does not assume any underlying distribution of the data.

The test statistic is calculated as:
$$\chi^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{k} \frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i}$$

where:
- $O_i$ is the observed number of events in group $i$
- $E_i$ is the expected number of events in group $i$
- $k$ is the number of groups
