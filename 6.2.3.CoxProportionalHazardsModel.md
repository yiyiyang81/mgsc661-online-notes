## Cox Proportional Hazards Model
By incorporating information on individuals in the analysis, we can build models that predict survival time based on covariates. 

Estimate the effects of covariates on the survival. The Cox method chooses to not directly focus on the survival function, but rather the hazard function. 

### Hazard Function
The hazard function $h(t)$ measures the instantaneous risk of an event happening at time $t$ given that the event has not happened yet, or simply the instantaneous "failure rate".

Mathematically, the hazard function is defined as:
$$h(t) = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{P(t \leq T < t + \Delta t | T \geq t)}{\Delta t}$$

which is the probability that the event occurs in the interval $[t, t + \Delta t]$ given that the individual survives until time $t$, divided by the length of the interval.

where:
- $T$ is the survival time
- $t$ is the time point
- $\Delta t$ is the interval length

### Types of Hazard Functions
- Constant Hazard - The hazard is constant over time, often seen in mechanical systems.
- Increasing Hazard - The hazard increases over time, often seen in biological systems as they age or as diseases progress.
- Decreasing Hazard - The hazard decreases over time, often seen in systems that have a "burn-in" period where the risk is high initially and decreases over time.

### Bathtub Curve
The hazard function can be visualized as a "bathtub curve" where the hazard is high initially, decreases over time, and then increases again. It describes the failure rates of product over time.

It is characterized by three periods:
- Early Failure Period: The hazard is high initially due to manufacturing defects or other issues.
- Constant Failure Period: The hazard is relatively constant over time.
- Wear-Out Failure Period: The hazard increases over time as the product ages and components wear out.

### Proportional Hazards Model
The harzard rate for an individual with covariates $X$ is given by:
$$h(t|X) = h_0(t) \exp(\beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + ... + \beta_p X_p)$$

where:
- $h_0(t)$ is the baseline hazard function
- exponential term adjust the baseline hazard rate based on the individual's covariates
- $\beta_i$ are the coefficients for the covariates
- $X_i$ are the covariates

An assumption of the Cox model is that the hazard ratios are constant over time, hence the term "proportional hazards".
By adjusting the $\beta$ coefficients for each individual $X$, we can describe how the hazard rate changes based on the covariates:
- positive $\beta$ indicates an increased hazard rate
- negative $\beta$ indicates a decreased hazard rate

#### Example: Smoking Status

If $\beta = 0.5$ for a covariate indicating smoking status(1 for smokers, 0 for non-smokers), then the hazard rate for smokers is $\exp(0.5) = 1.65$ times higher than non-smokers.

Interpretation: The hazard rate for smokers is 1.65 times higher than non-smokers.
