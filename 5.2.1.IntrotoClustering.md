## Purpose
- Finding groups of "clusters", which are similar observations in the dataset
- Supervised methods can effectively classify observations, while clustering is more about finding the natural groupings in the data

## Applications
- Customer segmentation for marketing
- Genetic similarities to describe geographic populations
- Facility location: determine number of warehouses to open based on customes' geolocations. K-means is a nice starting point for clustering, which solves exactly this problem, but there are many other clustering algorithms available.
