A lot of statistical methods are based on the assumption, for example, linear regression assumes the error distribution is normal. 

Such distribution do not always hold true in real world data. Boostraing takes the data that we have, and resamples it with replacement to create new datasets. This allows us to estimate the distribution of the data and the parameters of the model.

### Steps
1. From the current dataset, we resample the data with replacement to create new datasets.
2. Everytime we resample, we get relevant statistics of it, train the model and calculate the error.
3. We repeat this process multiple times to get a distribution of the error.
4. We can then calculate the confidence interval of the error.

The error tells us about the model performance, specifically the stability and variability of the model.
